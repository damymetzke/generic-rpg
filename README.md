# Generic RPG
This is, as the name suggests, a generic RPG.
It is a project using the Godot game engine, version 3.2.3-mono.
It is just a side project, nothing special.
I just like to put my projects on github.

## This project is "done"
I've done what I wanted to do with this project.
It was never meant to be finished.
Currently it is too difficult to continue because of some early design decisions.
It makes more sense to start a new project.
Therefore I will archive this repository.
